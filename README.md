# Docker Homework

## Orientation and Setup

* I provision the Docker with Visual Studio, so that I don't have to change my Windows 10 to Windows Pro or Education.

## Share images on Docker Hub

* When I tried to push the docker images to the docker repository, it gave me an error of "Permission Denied"

* I used docker login command to login to the Docker repository using my username and password, and push it again.
